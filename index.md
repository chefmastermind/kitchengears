Hey! I’m Daniel, and I’m really glad you found your way to this blog.

I created this little corner of the internet to celebrate life around the table and the good food that brings us all together.

**A bit about me.**

Back in 2015, I was working as a full-time musician by day and cooking up a storm by night. Now, I have the privilege of doing all the recipe-developing and writing for this site as my full-time job. And even after more than a decade of blogging, I can honestly say that I still absolutely love it. Seeing the recipes I create here in my tiny kitchen show up on your tables around the world makes my heart incredibly happy, and I work hard to ensure that this site remains a trustworthy resource for you to turn to.

Beyond the blog, I’m a born-and-raised Kansas guy currently living the expat life for a while in Barcelona, Spain. We try to make the most of those crazy-cheap RyanAir tickets and travel around Europe on the weekends as much as possible. But when we’re home, you can find us soaking up sunny terraces with friends, taking the pups for long walks along the shore, enjoying endless tapas and glasses of vermut, and just enjoying our cozy little apartment here in the city center.
