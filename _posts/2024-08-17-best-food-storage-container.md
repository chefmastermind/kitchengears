Keeping food fresh and safe is a top priority, but with all the concerns surrounding plastic, it's time to rethink our storage options. While sustainable food brands are gaining momentum, the containers we use to store our food are just as important. Traditional plastic containers often contain harmful chemicals that can have negative effects on both our health and the environment.

Even those labeled BPA-free aren’t always as safe as they seem. That’s why we’re taking a closer look at the safest food storage containers out there—ones that go beyond plastic to offer a healthier, more eco-friendly way to keep your food fresh.

I'm obsessed with Caraway's glass food storage containers! They're made with high-quality glass coated with non-stick ceramic, and the lids feature Air Release Technology, which keeps my food fresh and odorless.

I've got the set of small, medium, and large containers, which also came with minimalist fabric-covered storage slots to keep my cabinets tidy. I also picked up the Dot and Dash containers, which are perfect for dipping sauces and snacks.

After putting them to the test, I can confidently say they're some of the best non-toxic food storage containers out there. The non-stick coating is a game-changer - no more scrubbing away at last week's leftovers! The set also came with a magic cleaning eraser, which works wonders on tough stains.

One thing to note is that the ceramic coating can be scratched, so I make sure to use wood or silicone utensils when scooping from the containers.

I've also tested them in the freezer, dishwasher, and microwave (except for the Dot and Dash containers, as per Caraway's advice), and they perform flawlessly.

I love that Caraway offers a range of soft, minimalist colors - I opted for the lovely Sage color, which fits my green vibe perfectly.

What really impresses me is that Caraway's products are made by BSCI and SMETA production partners in China, and are free from BPA, BPS, PFOA, PTFE, and heavy metals. Plus, the non-stick ceramic coating produces 60% less CO2 than other non-stick coatings. Win-win!

The Hydro Flask Insulated Food Jar lives up to the brand’s reputation for quality and functionality. Known for their eco-friendly water bottles, Hydro Flask extends its innovative double-wall vacuum insulation technology to food containers, ensuring that meals like pasta, soup, and casseroles stay warm for hours.

Available in sizes ranging from 8 oz to 28 oz, these food jars are crafted from 18/8 pro-grade stainless steel, which is durable and resists flavor transfer. This means that each meal tastes fresh, without any lingering flavors from previous contents. The jars also feature a leak-proof seal, making them ideal for travel, and they are dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. However, they should not be used in ovens, microwaves, or freezers.

The jars come in a variety of colors, matching the aesthetic of Hydro Flask’s beloved bottles. Shipped in FSC-certified paper packaging, these containers align with Hydro Flask’s commitment to sustainability. Additionally, the brand’s Parks For All initiative supports the development of green spaces, enhancing accessibility to the outdoors.
