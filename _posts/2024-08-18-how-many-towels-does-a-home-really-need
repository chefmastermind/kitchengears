When I first set up my home, I never imagined how many towels I'd actually need. Sure, it seems straightforward—buy a few towels, and you’re good to go, right? Well, after a few years of dealing with everything from wet countertops to surprise guest visits, I’ve learned that towels are the unsung heroes of the household. Let me walk you through how I’ve stocked my own home with the perfect amount of towels for every occasion.

## Kitchen (Tea) Towels

Kitchen towels are, without a doubt, the workhorses of my home. They’re there for every spill, every hot dish out of the oven, and even as an impromptu apron when I’m up to my elbows in dough. I’ve found that having at least 10 kitchen towels on hand is ideal. This way, I’m never caught without a clean towel, even when I’ve used a couple at once. And honestly, with so many cute designs and colors out there, it’s hard to stop at just 10!

## Bar Towels

When I first started entertaining guests more often, I realized the value of having dedicated bar towels. These little guys are perfect for wiping down glassware, removing water spots, and keeping everything sparkling. If you’re like me and enjoy having friends over, you’ll want about 5-6 bar towels. But if you’re really into hosting or have a dedicated bar area, go ahead and bump that number up to 8-10.

## Dishcloths

For the longest time, I relied on old rags to clean dishes, but then I discovered the magic of good dishcloths. Made from absorbent microfiber, these cloths make dishwashing so much easier. They dry quickly and don’t leave a damp smell, which is a huge plus. I keep at least a dozen dishcloths in my drawer because, let’s face it, they handle the messiest of messes and need frequent washing.

## Washcloths

Washcloths are an essential part of my daily routine. Whether I’m using them to cleanse my face or remove makeup, they’re always in rotation. I’ve found that 4-5 washcloths per person is the sweet spot. For those in the household who don’t use them as often, 2 per person is usually enough.

## Hand Towels

In the age of constant handwashing, hand towels have become more important than ever. I prefer hand towels that are soft and dry quickly, and I make sure to have 3-4 per bathroom. This allows me to swap them out frequently, especially when I have guests over. If you have a bathroom that sees a lot of traffic, you might want to keep even more on hand.

## Bath Towels

Ah, bath towels—the soft, comforting end to a shower. Each person in my home has 2-3 bath towels, ensuring there’s always a clean one ready to go while the others are in the wash. And because I like to be prepared for guests, I always have a few extra bath towels in the closet.

In conclusion, the number of towels you need really depends on your lifestyle and how often you wash them. But with a little planning and the right number of each type, you’ll always have a fresh, clean towel at the ready. After all, in a world that’s constantly wet, it’s good to be prepared!
